This Project bases on the tricktaking code from the lecture code.

As it says in the assignment that the user may continue this
deal/hold/draw cycle indefinitely, the deck gets refilled before
it runs out of cards.

I implemented a separate executable class for each scoring algorithm.

I chose Bally's All American as the second way to score.
